# CoderFactory Curriculum

## Overview

CoderFactory is a forward thinking bootcamp based in Sydney, Australia. Its goal is to provide students with an education that leads them into a successful career in software development.

The course achieves this by teaching skills, ways of thinking and best practices that our aligned with our Industry partners needs.

The format of the course is 6 months, with 8 hours of face time per day with the students. The last month takes the form of an Internship with one of our partners, with the goal of the internship turning into full time employment.

This Repository reflects the courses curriculum. You might wonder why we have chosen to open source this material, the reasons are as follows:

 * There are millions of intelligent, proactive and driven technologists in the world. We want them to have the opportunity to contribute their wisdom to our course.

 * The course content and framework is a small portion of what we do. Our focus is on culture and context, our curriculum is simply one of the tools we use.

 * We want to provide resources for self-educators and developing countries to use. We, as technologists, have been gifted a lot from the tech community. This is our way of giving back.



## Contribution

### Key Principles

1. The units should be modular in nature. This means that they are able to be taught or learnt independently of any other source material.
2. The focus of each unit, week and term is a practical outcome, not a test of theoretical knowledge.
3. Use of external resources is actively encouraged. There is a lot of great information and tutorials in the world, leveraging them is a key to success.
4. We give credit where it is due. If you actively develop a unit, or contribute to our curriculum we will reference you and your github in class!

### Curriculum Format

The curriculums primary focus is on defining, and achieving, set goals. The course has an overarching goal of employability and competency. Each term and week has a goal for the practical application of what has been learnt so far. To properly approach the development of the curriculum it is necessary that you understand the following first, in this order.

1. Understand the courses overarching Objectives / Goals.
2. Understand or define the terms objective.
3. Understand the weeks objective (While understanding the context of other weeks within the term).
4. Understand the goal of the particular unit, both from a theory and practical standpoint.

By understanding the above, you will be able to provide insight and material that is relevant and helps the students progress on their journey.

Each Unit has the following sections:

1. Teaching Material | Practical & Theoretical.
2. The Challenge
3. Resources
